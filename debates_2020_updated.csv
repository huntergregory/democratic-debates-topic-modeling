In the last three years last three years billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. But you know what for the ordinary American things are not so good. Last year real wage increases for the average worker were less than one percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are under-insured. 45 million people are struggling with student debt. 500000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street including 30000 veterans.

12,02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Elizabeth Warren,Look the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas. Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who  want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and  going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008 we both got our chance but I dug in I fought the big banks I built the coalitions and I won.

13,02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Elizabeth Warren,I dug in I did the work and then Bernie team trashed me for it.

They  have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean look if you think the last four years has been chaotic divisive toxic exhausting imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because  right that there is a progressive majority an American majority that wants to see real change wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also  the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.,62.0,True,"[('russian', 1), ('they', 2), ('party', 1), ('chaos', 2), ('come', 1), ('year', 1), ('chaotic', 1), ('divisive', 1), ('toxic', 1), ('exhaust', 1), ('imagine', 1), ('spending', 1), ('well', 1), ('bernie', 1), ('sander', 1), ('versus', 1), ('donald', 1), ('trump', 1), ('think', 1), ('and', 1), ('meanwhile', 1), ('folk', 1), ('home', 1), ('south', 2), ('carolina', 1), ('bend', 1), ('try', 1), ('figure', 1), ('mean', 1), ('because', 1), ('progressive', 1), ('majority', 3), ('american', 2), ('want', 2), ('change', 1), ('wage', 1), ('faster', 1), ('health', 1), ('save', 1), ('retirement', 1), ('but', 1), ('able', 1), ('president', 1), ('feel', 1), ('blood', 1), ('pressure', 1), ('little', 1), ('bit', 1), ('instead', 1), ('roof', 1), ('opportunity', 1), ('set', 1), ('tone', 1)]"
17,02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Tom Steyer,Bernie Sanders' analysis is right. The difference is I  like his solutions. I  believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.,38.0,True,"[('bernie', 1), ('sander', 1), ('analysis', 1), ('the', 3), ('difference', 1), ('solution', 1), ('believe', 1), ('government', 4), ('takeover', 1), ('large', 1), ('part', 1), ('economy', 1), ('make', 1), ('sense', 1), ('work', 2), ('family', 1), ('present', 1), ('alternative', 1), ('include', 1), ('vibrant', 1), ('competitive', 1), ('private', 2), ('sector', 2), ('unchecked', 1), ('capitalism', 1), ('fail', 1), ('though', 1), ('corporate', 1), ('stranglehold', 1)]"

Donald Trump stinks. He incompetent.

It matters if you can actually get things done. It is not just who talks to the best who actually gets things done.

And actually I am the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered. The other issue is we  have enough personnel.

See all of these things are connected. Housing wages the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles to the closing of voting locations.

But here is the point. I am very proud of being Jewish. I actually lived in Israel for some months but what I happen to believe is that right now sadly tragically in Israel through Bibi Netanyahu you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country. And I happen to believe I happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the mid-east should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel.

Number one you  move the embassy back. We should not have done it without getting something from the Israeli government but it was done and  going to have to leave it there. Number two only solution here is a two state solution. The Palestinians have to be accommodated. The real problem here is you have two groups of people both of who think God them the same piece of land. And the answer is to obviously split it up leave the Israeli borders where they are.

That is a two state solution but  not up to us to determine what the terms of a two state solution are. We want to be a good ally to everyone in the region. The best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves. Donald Trump big mistake is he keeps putting a thumb on the scale on just one side.

And this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region because the president has basically vanished from the stage when it comes to even playing a role in the future there. Turkey Russia Iran all have so much more of a say than we do. We  have to be invading countries to be making a difference working with our international partners in order to deliver peace and support those who are standing up for self-determination. Now I want to come back to something and I promise it relates to international affairs because Senator Sanders asked me a question earlier. He asked the question of whether healthcare for everybody is a radical idea. And  not which is why  for it very much in a different way though.

We cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out. So for me this is about working with our allies. It is about standing with the people who are under enormous pressure right now.

1113,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very very close election last time in 2016 I see a state that yes has a high voter turnout fired-up Democrats just like my state which by the way Bernie when I led the ticket had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully Donald Trump worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else.

1115,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Tom Steyer,I  think  any question George that after this week  a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected. And I  think  any question but that the only way that  going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means  going to have to appeal across the spectrum moderates progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party including specifically the black community including specifically Latinos. If you  do that then we  beat Donald Trump in November and we  choose a candidate who  do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina with high numbers in Nevada.

George the entire capitalism socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models they did not foresee technology getting stronger more powerful capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now but people in New Hampshire know what else are at record highs? Mental illness stress debt substance abuse overdoses suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff we should be measuring our own health and wellness life expectancy mental health and freedom from substance abuse clean air and clean water how our kids are doing.

But  fundamental question about how we bring our party together. We have to think about it in new ways. People across this country whether  Democrats independents or Republicans understand that  got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and  not working so great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out for what it is.

In order to win yes but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we  even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically  facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar.

Look all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that  going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire a state that thinks for itself is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging.

The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together Republicans independents Democrats progressives conservatives you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that  not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations  going to start paying their fair share of taxes. That what the American people want. And  tell you something else the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.

1128,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,I think  a better way. It true the American people are ready.

There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we  command people to accept a public plan if they  want to. That the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes higher wages doubling the rate of unionization in this country making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share delivering healthcare and college affordability.

But Bernie says and he says he wrote the damn thing but  unwilling to sell us with the damn thing going to cost. The fact that  in New Hampshire very levelheaded group of people look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Who going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire the entire federal budget we spend now more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes  going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding.

I  tell you how much  going to cost.  find out later and  likely to be double whatever  everything we spent in the federal government. Who do you think is going to get that passed?

That the status quo Joe. That what Health and Human Services says.   And what we have got to do Joe and what we have got to do is understand simple question Joe we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans.

And it cost a lot of money it costs $750 billion over 10 years. I tell you how  going to pay for it.  going to raise the capital gains rates you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is.  pay for it  $800 billion.

It is not real Bernie because two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate are not on your bill and because it would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. And let me say what else Elizabeth wants to do it in two years. And Pete while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said henceforth forewith indubitably affirmatively you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position looking at things and sticking with them.

1142,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is 36 million Americans last year  afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance. I want everyone in here to think about what that means. They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor a doctor looked at it and says  serious enough to write a prescription. They walked out and then said  either that or groceries. It that or pay them rent on time. We have got to change our healthcare system. The way   Help to the most people as quickly as we can. How about we start with what a president can do I love saying this all by herself.

1143,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning but we have to agree to do that. We are the Democrats we are on the side of expanding healthcare.

1145,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,Sure. Well first of all just to be clear the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American. And as to experience I just bring a different perspective. Look I freely admit that if  looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt  got your candidate and of course  not me. The perspective  bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation. Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room.

1147,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Joe Biden,The politics of the past I think were not all that bad. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage.

1150,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,Those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment but now we have to meet this moment. And this moment is different. The next president is going to face challenges from global health security like what  seeing coming out of China to cybersecurity and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago. And here at home  seeing things like gig work transform what it means to be a worker in America in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago. We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back. We have to be ready to turn the page and change our politics before  too late.

Meeting the moment meeting the moment we had a moment the last few weeks mayor and that moment was these impeachment hearings. And there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people. There was courage from Doug Jones our friend of Alabama who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney who took it very very difficult vote. There was courage as I read today about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House what he did took courage.

It is much harder as I see Senator Shaheen in the front row such a leader it is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions. Because I think this going after every single thing that people do because  popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer. I just I  think  what people want right now.

1159,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Bernie Sanders,Look at the end of the day we got to ask ourselves a very simple question whether  healthcare in fact or anything else. Why are we the only major country on earth that  guarantee healthcare to all people? Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured? 30000 die because they  get to a doctor on time and 500000 people going bankrupt for what reason? Because they have cancer or heart disease or Alzheimer. We got to ask that question why is it why? Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years and here is the answer. If you want real change in healthcare at the end of the day  going to have to take on the insurance companies and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all not huge profits for the insurance companies.  going to have to take on the drug companies and their corruption and their price fixing and tell them Sorry  not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs than do the people of other country. But at the end of the day  no way around it. You may want to nibble around the edges but ultimately you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies to tell Wall Street to tell the insurance companies to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us not a handful of special interests.,87.0,True,"[('look', 1), ('end', 3), ('get', 2), ('simple', 1), ('healthcare', 6), ('anything', 1), ('why', 2), ('major', 1), ('earth', 1), ('guarantee', 1), ('pay', 2), ('highest', 1), ('price', 2), ('world', 1), ('prescription', 2), ('drug', 4), ('have', 1), ('million', 1), ('uninsured', 1), ('underinsured', 1), ('die', 1), ('doctor', 1), ('go', 4), ('bankrupt', 1), ('reason', 1), ('because', 1), ('cancer', 1), ('heart', 1), ('disease', 1), ('alzheimer', 1), ('talk', 1), ('hundred', 1), ('year', 1), ('change', 1), ('insurance', 3), ('company', 5), ('function', 1), ('huge', 1), ('profit', 1), ('corruption', 1), ('fix', 1), ('sorry', 1), ('time', 1), ('but', 1), ('you', 1), ('may', 1), ('nibble', 1), ('edge', 1), ('ultimately', 1), ('rally', 1), ('american', 1), ('wall', 1), ('street', 1), ('fossil', 1), ('fuel', 1), ('industry', 1), ('belongs', 1), ('handful', 1), ('special', 1), ('interest', 1)]"
1161,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Tom Steyer,I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate and  all right everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party and a million times better than Donald Trump. That is not the question in front of us today. The question in front of us today is how are we going to beat Donald Trump? You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992 and the mantra was It the economy stupid. Well if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying  saying those words It the economy stupid. I trust every one of these people a million times more but  going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy because if you listen to him  crowing about it every single day and  going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy stupid.

1162,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Tom Steyer,The question is who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump? Who can take down Mr. Trump because  the real threat to the country? And let me say you have to have experience to take him down. This is not a question of  a nice guy who going to listen. We need people with experience. That why  worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy and take him down on the debate stage or  going to lose. And  actually the issue in front of democratic voters. I have heard this debate so many darn times and I love all these people and  all right. If we win we can get the right thing Bernie. I am with you.

1164,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,Here how  going to win.  going to force this president to stand on that debate stage next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood in the industrial Midwest in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for but turns his back on.  going to put up somebody who not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party.  going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn and remind him what serving this country is really about. If we want to beat this president  got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past and unify this country around a new and better vision. That how  going to win.

It not. But the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it. I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that  spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester and in the other states that  in. And the important thing for the American people to remember is this is 2020  an election year. And if the Senate was the jury before you are the jury now.

And to be the kind of president to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father is an unbelievably dishonorable thing that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.,49.0,True,"[('go', 1), ('change', 1), ('subject', 1), ('this', 2), ('hunter', 1), ('biden', 3), ('abuse', 1), ('power', 1), ('the', 1), ('compete', 1), ('but', 1), ('get', 1), ('draw', 1), ('line', 1), ('and', 1), ('human', 1), ('seek', 2), ('son', 2), ('weaponize', 1), ('father', 1), ('unbelievably', 1), ('dishonorable', 1), ('example', 1), ('party', 1), ('completely', 1), ('united', 1), ('whatever', 1), ('take', 1), ('end', 1)]"

One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what  going to do and how  going to do it.

1211,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be. That my point. This is not an episode of 24. This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture.

Lindsey Graham has said  willing to leave troops for 100 more years. And yet what has all these years of war brought us? Right now the Afghan Government controls less than 60% of the land.

That does not make us safer. It does not make the region safer. It does not make the world safer. We should work with our allies in managing terrorism but we need to end this war in Afghanistan.

We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It  just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States coming into Europe.

What  hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the world policemen. And what  actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world.

And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes. It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries.

In some cases police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again sometimes more than once in a single day. It a healthcare issue but  also so much more. Mayor Buttigieg you have described yourself as a moderate but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go.

It why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable.  got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances.

Yes I felt that we should prosecute those people but when it comes to when you asked Mr. Yang a question and I think it we owe it to the people of New Hampshire had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed.  been very clear about this.,44.0,True,"[('lead', 1), ('successful', 1), ('drug', 2), ('court', 1), ('hennepin', 1), ('county', 1), ('always', 1), ('believe', 1), ('record', 1), ('show', 1), ('business', 1), ('repeat', 2), ('customer', 2), ('and', 2), ('treatment', 2), ('maybe', 1), ('refer', 1), ('deal', 1), ('yes', 1), ('felt', 1), ('prosecute', 1), ('come', 2), ('ask', 1), ('mr', 1), ('yang', 1), ('owe', 1), ('new', 1), ('hampshire', 1), ('biggest', 1), ('addiction', 1), ('rate', 2), ('country', 1), ('death', 1), ('opioids', 1), ('explain', 1), ('pay', 1), ('bed', 1)]"

Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion. And just like every other policy  proposed and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this I have showed how  going to pay for it.

New Hampshire is a battleground not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy. Senator Sanders for many voters in this Democratic primary your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues  been on the right side of them for a long time.

1270,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Bernie Sanders,But to answer your question I come like New Hampshire from a very very rural state. In Vermont until the last two years ago we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective. The world has changed. In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed and my view is right now we need universal background checks we end the gun show loophole we end the so called straw man provision.

We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety. We just keep coming back. We treat it like the public health emergency that it is.

We  get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots. Until we attack the corruption in Washington the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying  not going to be able to meet our promises. And one more until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make.

Vice President Biden on the issue of abortion in 2012 you said President Obama two Supreme Court picks of them there was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind did not come with an agenda. And  said before We both believed that we should not apply narrow litmus tests to appointees to the Supreme Court.

I said that  going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution. That not a specific test. It a generic test. And only way the only reason women have the right to choose is because  determined that  unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution. That what I said. And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan who worked for me we got onto the Supreme Court. I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court. I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in.

1285,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Joe Biden,Yes. Look  the deal. Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose. I would in fact if they rule it to be unconstitutional I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass I believe a bill that Excuse me legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey. It a woman right to do that. Period. And if you call that a litmus test  a litmus test but what I was talking about in the past so no one gets confused here is if there is no If you read the Constitution very very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights.

1287,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren,Look  lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and  what we have to remember about this. States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies then  going to mean we  simply rely on the courts.

In addition you have got to put it into law. Donald Trump and I think  really important to take it to him here when he was running for election and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail. He then dialed it back and said No I want to put doctors in jail. Is it a big surprise then  seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions.

1293,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,Well if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence. What  called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today. And the time has come for us to think bigger not just reforming the makeup of the court as America by the way has done several times in our history.

Mayor Buttigieg under your leadership as mayor a black resident in South Bend Indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident.

1309,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,Well the reality is on my watch drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average and specifically to marijuana lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system and my city was not immune.

But there were a lot of people including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point  great that everybody so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids but where were you when it came to marijuana where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.,55.0,True,"[('earlier', 1), ('talk', 1), ('opioids', 2), ('thankfully', 1), ('america', 1), ('well', 1), ('understand', 1), ('opioid', 1), ('addiction', 1), ('understood', 1), ('medical', 1), ('problem', 1), ('but', 1), ('include', 1), ('african', 1), ('american', 2), ('activist', 1), ('community', 1), ('make', 1), ('everybody', 1), ('enlighten', 1), ('drug', 1), ('policy', 1), ('come', 3), ('marijuana', 2), ('crack', 1), ('epidemic', 1), ('that', 1), ('reason', 1), ('call', 1), ('reform', 1), ('end', 1), ('incarceration', 3), ('response', 1), ('possession', 1), ('legalize', 1), ('retroactively', 1), ('expungements', 1), ('correct', 1), ('harm', 2), ('do', 1), ('case', 1), ('disproportionately', 1), ('black', 1), ('brown', 1), ('far', 1), ('offense', 1), ('intend', 1), ('deal', 1)]"

1314,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence which was slaughtering so many in our community burying teenagers disproportionately black teenagers we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.,27.0,True,"[('and', 1), ('strategy', 2), ('community', 2), ('adopt', 2), ('target', 2), ('case', 2), ('gun', 1), ('violence', 2), ('gang', 2), ('slaughter', 1), ('bury', 1), ('teenager', 2), ('disproportionately', 1), ('black', 1), ('say', 1), ('drug', 1), ('enforcement', 1), ('connection', 1), ('violent', 1), ('group', 1), ('connect', 1), ('murder', 1)]"
1315,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,These things are all connected but  the point.

1317,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren,No. You have to own up to the fact and  important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system. For the exact same crimes study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained to be arrested to be taken to trial to be wrongfully convicted and receive harsher sentences. We need to rework our criminal justice system from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system and how we help people come back into the community.,42.0,True,"[('you', 1), ('fact', 1), ('race', 1), ('totally', 1), ('permeate', 1), ('criminal', 2), ('justice', 2), ('system', 3), ('for', 1), ('exact', 1), ('crime', 1), ('study', 2), ('show', 1), ('african', 1), ('american', 1), ('likely', 1), ('white', 1), ('detain', 1), ('arrest', 1), ('take', 1), ('trial', 1), ('wrongfully', 1), ('convict', 1), ('receive', 1), ('harsher', 1), ('sentence', 1), ('rework', 1), ('front', 1), ('end', 1), ('illegal', 1), ('community', 1)]"
1318,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren,But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically. We need to start having race-conscious laws. Housing for example I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965. You  just repeal that and say Okay now everything is even. It not.

1319,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Andrew Yang,Elizabeth with respect you  regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country which is the most important number of them all. We  regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities.

I am the person on this stage who will say openly  for reparations. Something wrong happened. I am for reparations to African Americans in this country and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality. In fact three days ago one of the leaders of Joe Biden South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign.

We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare housing criminal justice education you name it. And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with. But in terms of criminal justice what we have got to do is understand the system is broken is racist. We invested our young people in jobs and education not more jails and incarceration.

1335,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Joe Biden, already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is I believe sorry for what he said. But  the deal folks.  got to stop taking the black community for granted. That the starting place. Every one of the things we talked about here for example in South Carolina Jim Clyburn he has a program 10-15-30. We should be investing our money in those communities that  gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense they go directly mandatory prison. I mean excuse me mandatory treatment not prison. And we fund it. And we fund it and three days  get it. It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress.

1336,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Joe Biden,Just like instead of building new prisons we build new rehabilitation centers. We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses. You know if you own a house I know you do know if you own a house in an all black neighborhood same exact house in all white neighborhood exact same shape the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth as my friend at the end of the line here says.

1337,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Joe Biden,I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement I became a public defender. That why I got involved. T so many things we have to do across the board and in education at-risk schools.

As you mentioned South Carolina three weeks from tomorrow  go to the polls to vote black voters make up about 60% of the electorate there. Senator Sanders several weeks ago Nina Turner one of your national co-chairs published an op-ed piece that said Vice President Biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress.

1339,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Bernie Sanders,Well I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden but no. Joe Biden is a friend of mine and  not here to attack him. But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education in healthcare. There is no excuse why white families in America have 10 times more wealth than black families. No excuse that disproportionately African Americans are in jail compared to whites.

1343,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,Yes I did because I think in addition to the economic argument  making here with the sad sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in New Orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby and 30% of African American kids being living in poverty we know that there are economic solutions here to invest in those communities housing childcare. But  something else insidious going on that we  addressed and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting. That is moves across the country to limit people right to vote and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18.

1349,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Joe Biden,But look Amy is right the senator correct. That is that we in fact there is systematic racism and  why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those. You know realize there are 35 states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting and brown as well black and brown people from voting.

1350,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren, glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is at least at election time. Year after year after year election after election after election Democrats go to people in the black community and say Boy we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible we all want to do something and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think  time we have real concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people lives. I proposed a two cent wealth tax. And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college borrow more money while  in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points.,59.0,True,"[('glad', 1), ('fellow', 1), ('democrat', 2), ('black', 2), ('community', 2), ('least', 1), ('election', 4), ('year', 1), ('boy', 1), ('care', 1), ('issue', 1), ('racism', 1), ('terrible', 1), ('somehow', 1), ('problem', 1), ('seem', 1), ('get', 1), ('worse', 1), ('well', 1), ('concrete', 1), ('plan', 1), ('go', 2), ('difference', 1), ('life', 1), ('propose', 1), ('cent', 2), ('wealth', 3), ('tax', 2), ('and', 1), ('thing', 1), ('cancel', 1), ('student', 2), ('loan', 2), ('debt', 1), ('million', 1), ('american', 2), ('african', 1), ('borrow', 2), ('money', 2), ('college', 2), ('harder', 1), ('pay', 1), ('law', 1), ('close', 1), ('blackwhite', 1), ('gap', 1), ('point', 1)]"

1354,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Tom Steyer,Out of narrative comes policy. And  talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans. But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly. Because everyone saying we  have rules that are different for different people but in fact  here because we had rules that are different for different people. I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans not just legal discrimination injustice and cruelty but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage  been done officially and pretending  all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way.

If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump. And in order to do that we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject but how we bring everybody into the fold. And if you are low-income or if  able to contribute a lot. If  always voted Democrat or if  an Independent or even a Republican who just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House we need you to join us right now.

1378,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,David Muir,Mayor Buttigieg thank you. I want to turn to climate change and jobs here in America. President Trump just signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement many call it an updated NAFTA. But it odes include incentives to make cars here in North America and it does open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers. Senator Sanders as we sit here in New Hampshire tonight both New Hampshire senators Maggie Hassan and Senator Jeanne Shaheen supported this calling it a real win for workers and for farmers.

1379,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Bernie Sanders,Yes. I mean  a disagreement but if you look at every environmental group in this country including the Sunrise organization  so proud to have their support because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate.

1380,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Bernie Sanders,There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I  know how in 2020 you can do that. Second of all there is in terms of outsourcing of jobs a major crisis in this country. Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico where workers are paid in some cases less than $2 an hour.

1382,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,Well first of all I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them. Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president yes  work to make this a part of every future trade agreement but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement which I will do on day one.,48.0,True,"[('well', 1), ('defend', 1), ('honor', 1), ('incredible', 1), ('senator', 1), ('new', 1), ('hampshire', 1), ('jeanne', 1), ('shaheen', 1), ('maggie', 1), ('hassan', 1), ('work', 3), ('hard', 1), ('state', 1), ('vote', 2), ('why', 1), ('because', 1), ('major', 1), ('improvement', 1), ('trade', 2), ('agreement', 3), ('come', 3), ('labor', 1), ('inspection', 1), ('get', 2), ('rid', 1), ('sweetheart', 1), ('pharma', 1), ('deal', 1), ('climate', 4), ('change', 4), ('north', 1), ('american', 1), ('trading', 1), ('block', 1), ('mexico', 1), ('canada', 1), ('america', 1), ('together', 1), ('future', 1), ('international', 1)]"
1383,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that and in future trade agreements that should be part of our negotiations.

1385,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren,Yes I did and  tell you why because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trump trade policies. There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they  get enforcement of any workers' rights. So this NAFTA provision after a lot of negotiation with Democrats Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better. This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country  saying  sign up for that and then  get up tomorrow morning and  start working hard for a better trade deal on climate a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it. Everyone wants to get to the American market.

1387,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Tom Steyer,Yeah I got to agree with Bernie Sanders I do. Senator Warren is right. Everybody wants to get into our market and  how we convince them that  got to be right on climate too. That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way. Yeah of course we want to make things better for American workers and  absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy  thinking about it from the point of view of the American people not of the American corporations. That a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that but  something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy. We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world.,57.0,True,"[('yeah', 2), ('get', 2), ('bernie', 1), ('sander', 1), ('senator', 2), ('warren', 1), ('everybody', 1), ('want', 1), ('market', 1), ('convince', 1), ('climate', 1), ('that', 2), ('make', 1), ('foreign', 2), ('policy', 3), ('decision', 1), ('old', 1), ('course', 1), ('thing', 1), ('well', 1), ('american', 3), ('worker', 1), ('absolutely', 1), ('critical', 1), ('trade', 1), ('think', 1), ('view', 1), ('corporation', 1), ('huge', 1), ('positive', 1), ('change', 1), ('and', 1), ('go', 1), ('talk', 1), ('kill', 1), ('general', 1), ('soleimani', 1), ('discussion', 1), ('leaf', 1), ('united', 1), ('state', 1), ('community', 1), ('nation', 1), ('world', 1)]"
1388,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Tom Steyer,So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks that makes a difference  going to have to put climate first and when we think about doing the wrong thing the way Mr. Trump did with General Soleimani we have to ask does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing?

1389,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Tom Steyer,Being all by ourselves being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world. So in fact the USMCA is something  the first step but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying. Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal.,29.0,True,"[('be', 1), ('empire', 1), ('star', 1), ('war', 1), ('movie', 1), ('position', 1), ('do', 2), ('leader', 1), ('free', 1), ('world', 1), ('usmca', 1), ('step', 2), ('exactly', 1), ('bernie', 1), ('sander', 1), ('say', 1), ('use', 1), ('access', 1), ('market', 1), ('negotiate', 1), ('represent', 2), ('american', 2), ('worker', 1), ('safe', 1), ('climate', 1), ('deal', 1)]"
1390,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things  always exactly how you would do them. But in this case if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends and I would agree he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies but I think  got to have some friends and those two countries our neighbors may not be perfect but they are our friends and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world and we have not talked about this enough.,31.0,True,"[('one', 1), ('thing', 2), ('arena', 1), ('decision', 1), ('always', 3), ('exactly', 1), ('but', 1), ('case', 1), ('criticize', 1), ('trump', 1), ('ever', 1), ('friend', 3), ('side', 2), ('tyrant', 1), ('innocent', 1), ('dictator', 1), ('ally', 1), ('get', 1), ('country', 1), ('neighbor', 1), ('may', 1), ('perfect', 1), ('literally', 1), ('blame', 1), ('everyone', 1), ('world', 1), ('talk', 1)]"
1391,02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong. He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the King of Denmark who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for he claims cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2 who does that? That what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies and New Hampshire is such a great example of this New Hampshire Bretton Woods New Hampshire with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone and that trade agreement was not perfect but the point of it is if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation security.,56.0,True,"[('blame', 4), ('barack', 1), ('obama', 1), ('everything', 1), ('go', 3), ('federal', 1), ('reserve', 1), ('chair', 1), ('appoint', 1), ('king', 1), ('denmark', 1), ('prime', 1), ('minister', 1), ('canada', 1), ('claim', 1), ('cut', 1), ('canadian', 1), ('version', 1), ('home', 1), ('alone', 2), ('that', 1), ('donald', 1), ('trump', 1), ('opportunity', 1), ('work', 2), ('ally', 1), ('new', 3), ('hampshire', 3), ('example', 1), ('bretton', 1), ('wood', 1), ('senator', 1), ('jeanne', 1), ('shaheen', 1), ('maggie', 1), ('hassen', 1), ('believe', 1), ('nato', 1), ('rest', 2), ('world', 3), ('see', 1), ('smaller', 1), ('state', 2), ('piece', 1), ('trade', 1), ('agreement', 1), ('perfect', 1), ('isolate', 1), ('hurt', 2), ('economically', 1), ('nation', 1), ('security', 1)]"

His loyalty among African American voters. I have sat down with the vice president he has told me  one of the things that he is most proud of his loyalty among black supporters and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base all you have to look at are the numbers from 2016 the exit polls from that primary 6 out of 10 voters in Mississippi were black 61% of voters in the South Carolina primary were black and  where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that.,36.0,False,"[('exactly', 1), ('devin', 1), ('steyer', 1), ('call', 1), ('lack', 1), ('discussion', 1), ('come', 1), ('race', 1), ('conversation', 1), ('turn', 1), ('minute', 1), ('biden', 1), ('tout', 1), ('national', 1), ('poll', 2), ('reflect', 1), ('his', 1), ('loyalty', 2), ('among', 2), ('african', 1), ('american', 1), ('voter', 4), ('sat', 1), ('told', 1), ('thing', 1), ('proud', 1), ('black', 4), ('supporter', 1), ('democratic', 1), ('base', 1), ('number', 1), ('exit', 1), ('primary', 2), ('mississippi', 1), ('south', 1), ('carolina', 1), ('candidate', 1), ('go', 1), ('head', 1), ('soon', 1), ('ahead', 1)]"

It to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids by cutting healthcare across the board by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement. It very simple. That what Mr. Trump plan is and  true in every single red state but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia South Carolina that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas Nevada.

He  understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump because he will never be able to imagine it.

That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get. But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran let face it Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion  had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic.

So the average family in America that today makes $60000 would pay $1200 a year compared to that family paying $12000 a year.

1643,01-14-2020,January Iowa Democratic Debate Transcript,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just  even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans healthcare plans that we have and these plans are paid for. The problem is that plans like the mayor and like the vice president is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who  afford to get them filled. What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top the top 1% to pay a little more.

1646,01-14-2020,January Iowa Democratic Debate Transcript,Entire Debate,Pete Buttigieg,It just not true that the plan  proposing is small.  got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.

1647,01-14-2020,January Iowa Democratic Debate Transcript,Entire Debate,Pete Buttigieg,Let measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes  taking on costs on prescription drugs  have an out-of-pocket cap. Even if you  get the subsidies that would make it free a $250 monthly cap and  why  got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that  got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits? It makes no sense medically because most of us  experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills  come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks biweekly or monthly.

1649,01-14-2020,January Iowa Democratic Debate Transcript,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,Look the numbers that the mayor offering just  add up. The average family in America last year paid $12000 in some combination of deductibles and copays and uncovered expenses and fees.

Then a few months ago you said No  going to wait a while to get there. And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what  talking about is true. And I  buy that  not enough. It is a big big step to say to people making $100000 a year that Your premiums will be cut in half. Which is what the nonprofit public option will do. And if you talk mayor Buttigieg about Medicare and having negotiation I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 co-sponsors. As president I can get it done.

There are two problems.  spending way too much because corporations own the system and  not negotiating against those corporations and  given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money.

We have another question from an Iowa Democratic voter. Mayor Buttigieg this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes As a young mom I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income. Many families  have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed.

But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that  working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense and it must change and we  be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality. Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large. We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.,63.0,True,"[('make', 4), ('sense', 2), ('childcare', 4), ('third', 1), ('somebody', 2), ('income', 2), ('get', 1), ('drive', 1), ('zero', 1), ('family', 1), ('living', 1), ('poverty', 1), ('but', 1), ('happen', 1), ('folk', 1), ('level', 2), ('spectrum', 1), ('meet', 1), ('professional', 1), ('sometimes', 1), ('work', 2), ('order', 2), ('able', 2), ('afford', 1), ('change', 1), ('afraid', 1), ('federal', 1), ('dollar', 1), ('reality', 1), ('subsidize', 1), ('building', 1), ('workforce', 2), ('paid', 1), ('decent', 1), ('offer', 1), ('early', 1), ('childhood', 1), ('education', 1), ('large', 1), ('biggest', 1), ('driver', 1), ('gender', 1), ('pay', 2), ('gap', 1), ('voter', 1), ('ask', 1), ('step', 1), ('reason', 1), ('disadvantage', 1), ('come', 1), ('affect', 1), ('rest', 1), ('career', 1)]"

Poverty you know the Poor People Campaign is marching on Iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith.

We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes. If he wants to send his kid to public university then  okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because  how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it bring down the national debt.

I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all  actually thinking big enough. I think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings and what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home healthcare workers that we  know how to fill in the next 10 years. We are going to have open 100000 jobs for nursing assistants. We as my union friends know  going to have over 70000 openings for electricians.  not going to have a shortage of MBAs.  going to have a shortage of plumbers. So when we look at that then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K-12 it should go into free one and two-year degrees like my dad got like my sister got.

We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud because during his campaign he told working people one thing and he ended up doing something else. I believe and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country who wants to cut social security Medicare and Medicaid after he promised he would not do that and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is yeah certainly I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies but what conservatives I think understand is that we cannot have a president with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.,74.0,True,"[('well', 1), ('judy', 1), ('pathological', 1), ('liar', 1), ('run', 1), ('corrupt', 1), ('administration', 1), ('modern', 1), ('history', 1), ('and', 2), ('fraud', 1), ('campaign', 1), ('told', 1), ('work', 2), ('end', 1), ('believe', 1), ('personally', 1), ('come', 1), ('week', 1), ('month', 1), ('make', 2), ('case', 2), ('sell', 1), ('family', 1), ('want', 1), ('cut', 1), ('social', 1), ('security', 1), ('medicare', 1), ('medicaid', 1), ('promise', 1), ('documentedly', 1), ('lie', 1), ('thousand', 1), ('time', 1), ('since', 1), ('yeah', 1), ('certainly', 1), ('disagree', 1), ('trump', 1), ('virtually', 1), ('policy', 1), ('conservative', 1), ('temperament', 1), ('dishonor', 1), ('presidency', 1), ('united', 1), ('state', 1)]"

1777,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,So I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night the president was impeached and everyone now in the Senate who taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution and that  mean loyalty to an individual it  mean loyalty to a political party it means loyalty to our country and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is  now seen the impact of corruption and   clearly on the stage in 2020 is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption originally his argument that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington broke that promise and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight not for the wealthy and well-connected but to fight for everyone else.

1779,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said The president is not king in America; the law is king. And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention and by the way I think  a pretty good size for a president he was five foot four. And what he said he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution that the provisions are in there is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.,53.0,True,"[('let', 1), ('case', 2), ('american', 2), ('wise', 1), ('judge', 1), ('say', 4), ('the', 1), ('king', 2), ('america', 1), ('law', 1), ('and', 2), ('james', 1), ('madison', 1), ('speak', 1), ('constitutional', 1), ('convention', 1), ('pretty', 1), ('size', 1), ('five', 1), ('foot', 1), ('reason', 1), ('impeachment', 1), ('article', 1), ('constitution', 1), ('provision', 1), ('fear', 1), ('betray', 1), ('trust', 1), ('foreign', 2), ('power', 1), ('that', 1), ('happen', 1), ('watergate', 3), ('this', 2), ('global', 1), ('paranoid', 1), ('face', 1), ('election', 1), ('look', 1), ('dirt', 2), ('opponent', 2), ('get', 1), ('call', 1), ('leader', 1)]"
1780,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,And I would make this case: as we face his trial in the Senate if the president claims that he is so innocent then why  he have all the president men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said Okay  going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.

The president left the House with no choice and I think a lot of us are watching this process watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate.

Here the good news   up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness to refuse and reject the cynicism.

Because I believe what counts here is actually the American people opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history  not a question of political expediency  not a question of political tactics  a question of right and wrong.

1792,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Andrew Yang,It clear why Americans  agree on impeachment.  getting our news from different sources and  making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating last I checked it was something like 17 percent and Americans  trust the media networks to tell them the truth.

The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see  going on in our communities and solve those problems. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place.

1794,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Judy Woodruff,Thank you Mr Yang. Let turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans and that is the economy. Senator Sanders today the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States Canada and Mexico.

Now I  agree with the your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow hopefully Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day in my view it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers stands up for farmers and by the way the word climate change to the best of my knowledge is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all which is an outrage.

It is equality of a product it is equality of our workers and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement while Senator Sanders is correct there are some issues with it is much better than the one originally proposed.

Also at record highs depression financial insecurity student loan debt even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people lived experience on the ground.

We have a government that works great for giant drug companies just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere but not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us.

Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy.

We can do even more for our public schools for college graduates we can cancel student loan debt but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires.  not eating more pizzas  not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs harder jobs longer hours.

We can also be smart about the promises  making. Make sure  promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. It why for example I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans but it  have to be free for the top. If  in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on that would make a big difference.

And going back something we talked about before the debate began this sense of breaking away from Elizabeth Warren by saying we can be big we can be bold we can have really progressive ideas but if we look like we are measuring our boldness just in how much tax we are putting on Americans how big the programs are going to be  just going to come back and hurt the democratic nominee.,35.0,False,"[('the', 1), ('difference', 1), ('heard', 1), ('end', 1), ('pete', 1), ('buttigieg', 1), ('say', 2), ('get', 1), ('promise', 1), ('and', 1), ('go', 3), ('talk', 1), ('begin', 1), ('sense', 1), ('break', 1), ('elizabeth', 1), ('warren', 1), ('bold', 1), ('progressive', 1), ('idea', 1), ('measure', 1), ('boldness', 1), ('tax', 1), ('put', 1), ('american', 1), ('program', 1), ('hurt', 1), ('democratic', 1), ('nominee', 1)]"

This is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs well-paid across the United States of America. Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we  declare a state of emergency on day one I  understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead.

The issue as you should know what the scientists are telling us is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change.  talking about the Paris Agreement  fine.  enough. We have got to and  introduced legislation to do this declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe just maybe instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction maybe an American president i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world.

Senator Warren a new question to you Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because  efficient affordable and virtually carbon free.

I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader.

So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes talking about  happening on the coast is I just did but also talking about  happening in the Midwest where  from. It not fly over country to me I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding.  seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills.

We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. That playing out in coastal areas around the country. The question is do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say We need to protect our people from climate change? Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground. Because  what we need to do and  literal and figurative. Here in California  forest fires and forest management.

I miss Kamala. I miss Cory though I think Cory will be back. I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid but black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers. The average net worth of a black household is only 10% that of a white household. For Latinos  12%. If  a black woman  320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth.

He does it all the time. And I have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with NATO.

You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare for all people which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change.

However it is not just about numbers. It about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best and that is the state of Minnesota it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage.

I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America whose voices get heard. I believe  talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out. And for me the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now  crowding in on 100000 selfies. That 100000 hugs and handshakes and stories. Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt stories from people who  pay their medical bills stories from people who  find childcare. Now most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken in order to have a conversation and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador.,77.0,True,"[('youngest', 1), ('woman', 2), ('ever', 1), ('inaugurate', 1), ('believe', 2), ('president', 1), ('obama', 1), ('talk', 2), ('power', 1), ('america', 1), ('whose', 2), ('voice', 2), ('heard', 1), ('color', 1), ('trans', 1), ('often', 1), ('shove', 1), ('and', 2), ('run', 1), ('campaign', 2), ('make', 1), ('decision', 1), ('decide', 1), ('business', 1), ('usual', 1), ('crowd', 1), ('selfies', 1), ('that', 1), ('hug', 1), ('handshake', 1), ('story', 4), ('struggle', 1), ('student', 1), ('loan', 1), ('debt', 1), ('pay', 1), ('medical', 1), ('bill', 1), ('find', 1), ('childcare', 1), ('now', 1), ('traditional', 1), ('mean', 1), ('go', 1), ('forth', 1), ('coast', 2), ('rich', 1), ('buck', 1), ('order', 3), ('picture', 1), ('take', 1), ('conversation', 1), ('maybe', 1), ('consider', 1), ('ambassador', 1)]"

Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing not even foreign interference to hold on to power.  already put together more than $300 million. This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we  try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way  going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that  a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in 10 bucks  great. And if you can drop $1000 without blinking  great too.

We have so many important topics to discuss. I want to come to you Senator Klobuchar on a question of the judges. President Trump has appointed as we know two Supreme court justices but  also had confirmed nearly 200 federal judges most of whom are young and could shape American law for decades to come.

And I want to make it clear that  opposed many many judges and I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh Hearing when that nominee went after me. I stood my ground and he had to apologize. So I have been very strong on these judges. As for the judge you just referred to there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they  but what would I do as president?

People like Mimi Wright who a superstar and Susan Richard Nelson look at who I put in as the first openly gay Marshall in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.,53.0,True,"[('and', 1), ('record', 1), ('lawyer', 1), ('judiciary', 1), ('committee', 1), ('judge', 4), ('recommend', 1), ('president', 1), ('obama', 2), ('people', 1), ('mimi', 1), ('wright', 1), ('superstar', 1), ('susan', 1), ('richard', 1), ('nelson', 1), ('openly', 1), ('gay', 1), ('marshall', 1), ('history', 1), ('united', 1), ('state', 1), ('knew', 1), ('qualify', 1), ('job', 1), ('knowhow', 1), ('that', 1), ('learn', 1), ('deal', 1), ('economic', 1), ('crisis', 1), ('hard', 1), ('immediately', 1), ('put', 1), ('bench', 1), ('fill', 1), ('vacancy', 1), ('reverse', 1), ('horrific', 1), ('nature', 1), ('trump', 1)]"

I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history.

Joe  also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do is I think rethink and the Washington post piece was very educational. What we need to rethink is the entire war on terror? We have lost thousands of our own men and women brave soldiers.

She was the only person in the house to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right I was wrong. So was everybody else in the house. But to answer your question I  think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3:00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds.

Mayor Buttigieg you served in this war but I want to ask about your decision making if you were elected Commander in Chief. You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country.

The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement. But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were marveling at is how long  been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and  still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity. The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos.

2086,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,And  glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned not only because of what s talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war anytime we seek an authorization it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it it has to be brought to Congress brought to the American people and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote.,49.0,True,"[('and', 1), ('glad', 1), ('name', 1), ('barbara', 1), ('lee', 1), ('mention', 1), ('talk', 1), ('year', 1), ('believe', 1), ('choice', 1), ('afghanistan', 1), ('leader', 1), ('effort', 1), ('repeal', 1), ('replace', 1), ('authorization', 2), ('military', 1), ('force', 2), ('folk', 1), ('serve', 1), ('deserve', 2), ('they', 1), ('clarity', 1), ('member', 2), ('congress', 3), ('able', 1), ('summon', 1), ('courage', 1), ('vote', 2), ('ought', 1), ('anytime', 2), ('deploy', 1), ('troop', 1), ('war', 1), ('seek', 1), ('sunset', 1), ('conversation', 1), ('extend', 1), ('brought', 2), ('american', 1), ('tough', 1)]"

An issue that voters tell us every day is still the number one priority for them. Senator Sanders  spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your Medicare for all plan. But the reality is that if Republicans retain control of the U S Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress.

When 87 million people are uninsured or under insured. When 30000 people are dying each year because they  get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have.

Now to answer your question I think when we go out to the American people and tell them that right now we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry for example. Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as  charged in this country. Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care dental care eyeglasses and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about.

2092,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 2,Joe Biden,I  think it is realistic but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. It remind everybody 20 million people got insurance  have it before. All people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered. I could go on. We  get all that we wanted but now that  been exposed that taking it away has such dire consequences.  added to the Obamacare plan the Biden Initiative which is a public option. Medicare if you want to have Medicare.for reducing significantly the price of drugs deductibles et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion dollars.

2094,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 2,Joe Biden,I know. So look it covers everybody. It realistic and most importantly it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer. Like many of you had.

2098,12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 2,Bernie Sanders,That is exactly true. Thank you. And by the way Joe under your plan you asked me how are we going to pay for it? Under your plan  tell you how  paying for right now. The average worker in America their family makes 60000 a year. That family is now paying $12000 a year for health care. 20% of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying $1200 a year because  eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending  Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans.,46.0,True,"[('that', 2), ('exactly', 1), ('true', 1), ('thank', 1), ('and', 1), ('joe', 1), ('plan', 3), ('ask', 1), ('go', 1), ('pay', 4), ('under', 1), ('the', 1), ('average', 1), ('worker', 1), ('america', 1), ('family', 3), ('make', 1), ('health', 1), ('care', 1), ('income', 1), ('medicare', 1), ('eliminate', 1), ('profiteer', 1), ('drug', 1), ('company', 2), ('insurance', 1), ('end', 1), ('byzantine', 1), ('complex', 1), ('administration', 1), ('thousand', 1), ('separate', 1), ('healthcare', 1)]"

It costs 30 trillion dollars. Let get that straight. $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs 20 trillion. Some say it cost 40. The idea that  going to be able to save that person making $60000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. 16% of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now.

But where I disagree is I just  think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time.

Not everyone by any means that got elected in that last election in the democratic party. It is with the new governor democratic governor of Kentucky that wants to build on Obamacare.

We need a vision which says that in our great country all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living have health care have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income.

Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically. Senator Warren you have said already that  seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office.

And the obvious answer is to say first read the Mueller Report all 442 pages of it that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice and when Congress failed to act at that moment and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And   happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.

This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine but every step of the way puts his own private interests his own partisan interests his own political interests in front of our country interest.

But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump because if we are you know what?  going to lose the election. Right now  got 87 million people who have no health insurance or under-insured. We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change. You got 500000 people sleeping out on the street and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words we can deal with Trump corruption but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt dominated by a handful of billionaires and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.

And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President from what we heard today the Vice President the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff. And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward but it also points to another issue.,40.0,True,"[('well', 1), ('criminal', 2), ('living', 1), ('white', 1), ('house', 1), ('biggest', 1), ('tender', 1), ('moment', 1), ('justice', 1), ('ballot', 1), ('and', 2), ('saw', 1), ('ambassador', 1), ('sondland', 1), ('word', 1), ('told', 1), ('everyone', 1), ('loop', 1), ('that', 1), ('mean', 1), ('enterprise', 1), ('engage', 1), ('president', 2), ('heard', 1), ('vice', 1), ('secretary', 1), ('state', 1), ('chief', 1), ('staff', 1), ('point', 2), ('corrupt', 1), ('nature', 1), ('administration', 1), ('impeachment', 1), ('proceeding', 1), ('another', 1)]"

Because what it means when I watch this is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America. The powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else. Because  the thing. For those working people who are working two and three jobs if they  pay that credit card by the end of the month they get a penalty. For the people who  pay their rent they get evicted.

2177,11-20-2019,November Democratic Debate Transcript  5th Debate Transcript from Atlanta,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us. And that is that we want to build an America that works for the people not one that just works for rich folks. You know I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first 50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars  got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here the thing doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.

One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it.

First of all the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements we must start negotiating back with Russia which has been a horrible player on the international scene.

We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry divisiveness and attacks that have unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country. Beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.

I talked to an anti- hate activist named Christian Picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period. He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now  out and  helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.

What we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks.

And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example and that is student loan debt. Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college borrow more money while  in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America a new study came out 20 years out. Whites borrowed money 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt. 5% of African Americans had paid it off.

2522,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think  the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president I certainly  think it was going to be about impeachment but when the Mueller report came out I read it all 442 pages. And when I got to the end I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that  happen and look what happened as a result Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer broke it again this fall. You know we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States.

2524,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Bernie Sanders,No they . In my judgment Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension.

If they did that they would have no choice no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding which gives them more power to seek more information. This president and I agree with Bernie Senator Sanders is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history.

During that election Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He been selling out working people. He been selling out our values  been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine  been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances.

You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine  digging up dirt on an opponent  illegal conduct. That what he was doing. He  talk to them about the Russian invasion he talked to him about that. So  still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again.  like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter our allies for slaughter where Russia then steps in to protect them how that makes America great again.,60.0,True,"[('thing', 1), ('job', 1), ('constitutional', 1), ('duty', 1), ('pursue', 1), ('impeachment', 1), ('america', 4), ('president', 1), ('put', 1), ('front', 1), ('personal', 1), ('interest', 1), ('stand', 2), ('worker', 1), ('ohio', 1), ('farmer', 1), ('iowa', 1), ('and', 1), ('step', 2), ('you', 1), ('make', 4), ('head', 2), ('ukraine', 2), ('dig', 1), ('dirt', 1), ('opponent', 1), ('illegal', 1), ('conduct', 1), ('that', 1), ('russian', 1), ('invasion', 1), ('talk', 1), ('wait', 1), ('find', 1), ('try', 1), ('involve', 1), ('interfere', 1), ('election', 1), ('hear', 1), ('leave', 1), ('kurd', 1), ('slaughter', 2), ('ally', 1), ('russia', 1), ('protect', 1)]"

Because Ohio Michigan and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs not gained them.

Look the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations but actions that he has confessed to on television. It also about the presidency itself because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember one way or the other this presidency is going to come to an end.

And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats he won that election in 2016. The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House and I think that it should continue to play its course out together.

We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.

You know the way I see this is I have been out all around this country.  done 140 town halls now. Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico shoot I have done 70000 selfies which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So  talked with the family the mom and dad whose daughter been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes.  talked to the young man who has M.S.

2562,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,Look the way I see this it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer.

This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature Senator is to have a plan for everything except this no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself. But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it. We take a version of Medicare we let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan you can do that too. That is what most Americans want.

2568,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,So let be clear whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it understand what that really means. It Medicare for All who can afford it and  the problem  got. Medicare for All is the gold standard. It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American including the family whose child been diagnosed with cancer including the person who just gotten an M.S. diagnosis. That how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this  laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy  going to go up for big corporations.

It just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I  understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years when we could achieve that same big bold goal. And once again  competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now.

Let be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote premiums are gone co-payments are gone deductibles are gone. All out of pocket expenses are gone.  going to do better than the Canadian doing that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills.

2576,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Elizabeth Warren,My view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot.

I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and  have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And  tired of hearing whenever I say these things Oh  Republican talking points.

I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare. And back when I was studying it two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem  got right now is the overall cost of healthcare. And look you can try to spin this any way you want.  spent my entire life on working on how America middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works.

2582,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Amy Klobuchar,Yes I do and I appreciate Elizabeth work. But again the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers me about this discussion which  had so many times is that we  talk about the things that  hearing about from regular Americans that is longterm care. We are seeing I once called it a silver tsunami the aging and then someone told me that was too negative. So I call it the silver surge the aging of the population.

We can go into that I can talk about that if  like. But  the deal on the single most important thing facing the American public I think  awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how  going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs but for people making between $50 and $75000 year their taxes are going to go up about $5000 because the fact is  pay more in new taxes 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.

It helps all Americans transition because the fact is and you know this in Ohio if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.

They  know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives. I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. This has to do with bad trade deals that  seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans whatever we choose to do with our lives and we  forget that.,57.0,True,"[('thank', 1), ('you', 1), ('get', 1), ('heart', 1), ('fear', 2), ('found', 1), ('automation', 1), ('revolution', 1), ('uncertainty', 1), ('they', 1), ('go', 1), ('affect', 1), ('job', 3), ('everyday', 1), ('life', 3), ('friend', 1), ('andrew', 1), ('yang', 1), ('universal', 1), ('basic', 1), ('income', 1), ('idea', 1), ('provide', 2), ('security', 1), ('freedom', 1), ('kind', 1), ('choice', 1), ('this', 1), ('trade', 1), ('deal', 1), ('see', 1), ('past', 1), ('driven', 1), ('towards', 1), ('lose', 1), ('family', 1), ('really', 1), ('serve', 1), ('interest', 1), ('american', 2), ('believe', 1), ('federal', 1), ('guarantee', 1), ('the', 1), ('value', 1), ('feel', 1), ('define', 1), ('intrinsic', 1), ('whatever', 1), ('choose', 1), ('forget', 1)]"

2631,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Cory Booker,Well first of all the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for this Doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people pockets than giving them $1000 a month. We have to start putting the dignity back in work. Number one you start having trade deals. Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and  put workers at the center of every trade deal.

I stood with unions because right now unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country. So the other thing that  do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.,36.0,True,"[('but', 1), ('stood', 2), ('worker', 4), ('see', 2), ('trend', 1), ('union', 5), ('america', 1), ('attack', 1), ('membership', 1), ('go', 1), ('stratification', 1), ('wealth', 1), ('income', 1), ('united', 1), ('state', 1), ('fight', 1), ('strength', 1), ('spread', 1), ('sectorial', 1), ('bargaining', 1), ('auto', 1), ('fast', 1), ('food', 1), ('ensure', 1), ('improve', 1), ('condition', 1), ('american', 1), ('living', 1), ('wage', 1)]"

Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage. If we compliment that with investment in world-class pre K through 12 public education get behind our world-class public school educators if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years we will make sure that every single American has a shot.

The truth is we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.

There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It absolutely wrong. It absolutely undemocratic and unfair.

2643,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Tom Steyer,But  something else going on here that is absolutely shameful and  the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor people  had a raise. 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation you get 11 bucks. It seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers  be over 20 bucks.

You  justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We can eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.

The problem is that  been tried in Germany France Denmark Sweden and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that  projected.

Instead we should look at what Germany France Denmark and Sweden still have which is a value-added tax.

2757,10-15-2019,October Democratic Debate Transcript: 4th Debate in Ohio,Entire Debate,Pete Buttigieg,But this is really important because what this President has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies or sometimes allies too. Remember the problem right now is not just with our competitors. In for example a place like China the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and  get a peep of support from the President. It not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia but our one-time allies like Saudi Arabia which the CIA just concluded was responsible as we all knew for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist and Turkey which was an American ally.

This is an American President that even right now is lying to the American public and saying  bringing our troops home.

There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour. So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well.

I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again because the fact is after you save someone who ODing you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.

Actually I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing but we agreed on that. And after we joined forces he said to me Kamila you know Appalachia loves this. And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I guess  why  running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump but also to heal our country. We need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.

People who were radically different from me different generation different race definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire they  care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend. They  care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other. In fact the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important.

I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president.

I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate so we had to go back to the drawing board. And I worked with John McCain and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted but it turned out that we were able to pass a very very significant piece of legislation including $5 billion more for the veterans administration. More recently I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah mike Lee. And Mike understood although he and I disagree on everything that the US involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen.

But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system I would try to do it from the inside. So I took on the position that allowed me without asking permission to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.

So when I was there the way we handled these police shootings I actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis but in the prosecutor office they were handled with a grand jury. That how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside I am proud of the work our staff did 400 people in our office.

Why  it happen? And the answer is corruption pure and simple. We have a congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless  willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster  not going to get anything done on guns.

That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60 65 70% at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons.

If they do not I will take executive action and I will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy  had. I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law and I will ban by executive order the importation of assault weapons because  going to tell you as a prosecutor I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.

Well what you see here this is his average approval rating. Meaning  always got these different polls out there. One day NBC will have one the next day CNN will have one.  always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average a day to day average of all of those polls put together.

5622,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,And what I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark. His peak as president. His average approval rating at its best 46%. And when was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become president. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60 65 70% at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons.

5623,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,But that comes with a flip side and that is the basement for Trump. Look at this. 37% is the low point  hit in his average approval rating is president. That is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone.  seen Nixon Bush Senior Carter. We saw them fall into the 20s at some point during their term. That has not happened to Trump either. 37 in the low end 46 on the high end right now somewhere in between. It a very narrow range.

5624,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki, tell you it speaks to something else. Is this presidency really any different politically in terms of how  being received than the campaign in 2016? Because compare this trendline 46 37 low high. Compare that to Trump support against Hillary Clinton in the polls in the fall of 2016. Trump average support at a low point 36% at a high point about 43 and a half percent. Of course on election day what was the number he hit? 46%. The same high water mark  had in his approval rating. So Trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate as president. We say it speaks to polarization.

Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like them? Do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did.  not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was one of the big reasons his opponent Hillary Clinton by election day 2016 almost as unpopular as he was only 43% favorable it created that narrow path for Trump.

5685,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,All right. Let take a look at the electoral college and 2020. The place to start obviously is where the last election ended 2016. And remember of course by the popular vote Hillary Clinton had almost 3 million more of those than Donald Trump but we  elect the president by national popular vote. We do it by the electoral college and there Donald Trump had the right combination of votes in the right states enough to win 306 electoral votes for him.,,False,"[('all', 1), ('let', 1), ('electoral', 3), ('college', 2), ('the', 1), ('obviously', 1), ('election', 1), ('end', 1), ('and', 1), ('remember', 1), ('course', 1), ('popular', 2), ('vote', 4), ('hillary', 1), ('clinton', 1), ('almost', 1), ('million', 1), ('donald', 2), ('trump', 2), ('national', 1), ('combination', 1), ('state', 1)]"
5686,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,o how is that map looking for 2020? Well first of all I think one thing you need to do just understand how narrow that Trump path was in the electoral college in 2016. You can start by looking at Wisconsin. Look at that margin there. Fewer than 25000 votes separated Clinton from Trump in Wisconsin. This was a state that had not gone for a Republican in a presidential election since 1984 by a margin of fewer than 25000 votes Trump becomes the first in over three decades. He gets Wisconsin. The margin in Michigan even closer. Barely 10000 votes Trump over Clinton. And again that was the first time since '88 that a Republican carried Michigan. And then there was Pennsylvania here about 44000 votes. That the margin for Trump over Clinton in Pennsylvania. Trump wins all three of those states Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania by a combined total of about 75000 votes. That it. But  enough to win the electoral college.,,False,"[('map', 1), ('look', 3), ('well', 1), ('narrow', 1), ('trump', 6), ('path', 1), ('electoral', 2), ('college', 2), ('you', 1), ('wisconsin', 4), ('margin', 4), ('fewer', 2), ('vote', 5), ('separate', 1), ('clinton', 3), ('this', 1), ('state', 2), ('go', 1), ('republican', 2), ('presidential', 1), ('election', 1), ('since', 2), ('becomes', 1), ('decade', 1), ('get', 1), ('the', 1), ('michigan', 3), ('closer', 1), ('barely', 1), ('and', 2), ('carry', 1), ('pennsylvania', 3), ('that', 2), ('win', 1), ('combine', 1), ('total', 1), ('but', 1)]"
5687,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,o for Democrats they want to reverse the result of 2016 that is the easiest and most direct path at least on paper. You flip those states were Trump margin was the narrowest those states that had been voting democratic before 2016 you flip them back you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same. So  the most direct path for Democrats at least on paper. But hey things can change over the course of a few years.

5688,06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12, give you an example. Perfect one right here Florida. We always talk about Florida right? Remember Florida Florida Florida Florida from back in 2000. Well  one again Donald Trump was somewhat of a surprise on election night. I think the Clinton campaign had been feeling decent about Florida but Trump pulled out Florida in 2016. 29 electoral votes right there. We obviously expect to be very competitive in 2020 if the Democrats can flip Florida just given the size of the state that is a massive change. The one cautionary note for Democrats though they had a big year in the 2018 midterms it was not big enough to carry over to Florida. In Florida in the 2018 midterms a Republican won the Governor race. Republican won the Senate race ousted a Democratic incumbent in fact in that Senate race. So Florida  tantalizing on paper for Democrats.

Senator Warren  going to get to a gun question here. Parkland Florida  just north of here in Broward County. As you know it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue.

That our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence children and teenagers.

We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war.

You know guns in the hands of a collector who had them for decades who never fired Who take safety seriously. That very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.

Someone I knew Shahad Smith was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency.

I look at these proposals and I say Does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand? Coming from a proud hunting and fishing state. These proposals  do that. When I was a prosecutor I supported the assault weapon ban. When I was in the senate I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed. And then now these Parkland kids from Florida they started literally a national shift. You know why? It just like with gay marriage.

When the United States presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward. But unfortunately under this administration President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He diminished our standing in the world and  made us weaker as a country. Less able to confront challenges whether  Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.

So  been in congress 17 years and 12 of those years  sat on the Armed Services Committee the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee and the lesson that  learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It long. It tedious. But right now we have So I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our state department engaged. We much have our military engaged to the extent they need to be.
