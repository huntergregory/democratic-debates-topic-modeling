Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won.

      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen.

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.\n",

And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.\n",

Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof.

      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should.

I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks.

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

Raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour, making public colleges and universities tuition free and finally doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right to a Medicare For All single payer system  .\n",

Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.\n",

In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should.

Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.\n",

      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

Why would the Russians to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?\n",
      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done. We got a lot done.\n",

Why would the Russians to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?\n",
      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done. We got a lot done.\n",

Why would the Russians to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?\n",
      "15    I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n",

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done. We got a lot done.\n",

Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n",

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy   that works for American working people.\n",
      "21    We talk about progressive, let’s talk about being progressive. Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done. We got a lot done.\n",
